# UNBEATABLE TIC TAC TOE BOT
## By Deiahri and Michael Ly, inspired by Gregory Gaines

Using techniques I and Michael Ly learned in our Artificial Intelligence course, we designed an AI that can be defeated by *NO MORTAL BEING*. Go [here](https://deiahri.github.io/TicTacToe.js) to try your luck against the not-luck-based AI.

We used the minimax algorithm to calculate the best moves for the AI.
